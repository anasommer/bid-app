# [NorOff Semester Project 2 Course Assignment] | [Front-End Development 2 year]

[Project plan in Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/IiYfKAsm/ATTIee7157dd1f9617e65a72ab4292a95c7f69986830/semester-project-2)

## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

To complete the required features, I used GET, POST, and PUT HTTP methods.

## Description

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
